    <p> <b>Members of Tank and the Bangas met at a New Orleans open mic show called
        Liberation Lounge at now closed Blackstar Cafe and Books in the Algiers section of New Orleans and
        formed the group in 2011.
        The group was founded and fronted by Tarriona <i>"Tank"</i> Ball on lead vocals; Ball first gained attention as a slam
        poet. Other members
        include Joshua Johnson on drums and as musical director, Norman Spence on bass and synth keys, Jonathan Johnson
        on bass, Merell Burkett on keyboard, Joe Johnson on
        keyboard, Anjelika <mark> "Jelly"</mark> Joseph and Kayla Buggage on background vocals, Albert Allenback on alto saxophone and
        flute, and Etienne Stoufflet on tenor saxpahone.

        <p> Led by frontwoman Tarriona “Tank” Ball, the group is the lovechild of the rich New Orleans music scene and spoken
    word. Their first studio album, Thinktank, showcased their ability to perfectly blend jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop,
    spoken word — and their weirdness. With their sometimes comical, quick-witted lyrics, Tank and the Bangas captured
    audiences with their ability to tell a gripping story. After a six-year stretch of not releasing an album, the band
    is back with their second full-length record, Green Balloon.</p>  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d442130.5514755871!2d-90.16275326139586!3d30.032699596934652!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8620a454b2118265%3A0xdb065be85e22d3b4!2sNew%20Orleans%2C%20LA%2C%20USA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sco!4v1568771793364!5m2!1sen!2sco"
